 * Numerology is the study of numbers and their meanings. Every letter in the alphabet has 
 * a numerical value that when added up can relate your personal characteristics as well as
 * help to chart your future.

Beginnings

The roots of numerology can be found in many of the ancient civilizations such as China, Egypt, Greece,
 * Babylonia, Britain, and Tibet. Numerology has been the basis for which many scientists, philosophers,
 * theologians and mathematicians have based their theories. Einstein, Pythagoras and Plato all believed that 
 * the mystical secrets of life could be discovered through number arrangements.

Pythagorean System

A popular type of numerology is used in the Pythagorean system. Convert every letter in
 * your name to the related number adding up a total in the end to find out what numerology says about you.

In most cases you’ll wind up with a double digit. In this case you would add up the two digits to get a result.

Example: Jane Doe 12 + 15 = 27

Adding the numbers 2 and 7 will give you a result of 9. This becomes the numerical value of Jane Doe’s name.

B K T -2
C L U -3
 D M V -4
E N W -5
F O X 6
G P Y -7
H Q Z - 8
I R -9


Example: Jane Doe 12 + 15 = 27

Adding the numbers 2 and 7 will 
give you a result of 9. This becomes
 the numerical value of Jane Doe’s
 name.

 Dreams provide us with a key to unlock our unconscious mind. Being able to interpret our dreams, 
 * gives us an opportunity to understand ourselves on a deeper level. But what do our dreams really mean? Below 
 * are some traditional interpretations of common themes and symbols that appear in our dreams.

Baby: Babies in dreams indicate celebrations and good luck in general.

Bells: Hearing the ringing of bells in a dream indicates that good news is on its way to you.

Dog: Dogs in dreams represent your friends. If the dog is happy and friendly then all is well, but if a dog barks or 
 * attempts to bite you - keep an eye on someone close to you.

Clouds: White clouds indicate good fortune; dark clouds indicate troubled times ahead.

Falling: If you dream that you are falling, you may be feeling anxious or insecure about something.

Frog: Frogs in dreams indicate surprises and good news, often relating to matters of the heart.

Hair: If you dream that you hair is falling out, wait a little before beginning a new project. Dreaming that 
 * you have thick, lustrous hair is a good omen.

Horse: A white horse in a dream is a symbol of new love coming into your life. Brown and black horses indicate news from afar.

Jewelry: Good fortune is highlighted for you.

Keys: A new opportunity awaits you; a door will soon open for you.

Ladder: If you dream of climbing up a ladder, success is on its way, if you’re climbing down the ladder prepare for some disappointment.

Nudity: A very common dream symbol; if you dream of being nude in public it may be that you are wearing your heart on your 
 * sleeve too much, or being too open or frank with other people.

Pig: Pigs in dreams are a lucky omen. You could be on the brink of a major success.

Rainbow: Dreaming of a rainbow is incredibly lucky. Good news and happiness is on the way.

Ring: Dreaming of a ring is an indicator of an upcoming engagement or marriage

School: Dreaming that you are in a school indicates that you need to acquire more knowledge about something.

Snake: Be careful who you trust, someone you know may not be all that they appear to be.

Teeth: Another common dream symbol; if you dream of losing your teeth you may be worried about your finances. Growing new teeth 
 * can indicate a pregnancy for yourself or someone you know.

Window: If you dream that you’re looking out of a window, good news from far away is on the cards for you.

 * Relationships by element

Of course, in astrology and compatibility any combination of signs can work well together, 
 * it’s just that some work better than others. All combinations will have positives and negatives and
 * of course it takes effort, compassion and forgiveness to maintain any loving relationship.

Below is a guide to all relationship combinations as grouped by their element. All you need to do
 * is look up your element and that of the person you want to compare astrology and compatibility with.

Fire - Fire

This is a good combination as both are energetic, enthusiastic and share a love of adventure. 
 * Inability to compromise or cooperate may cause conflict in this combination.

Fire - Earth

This is a case of opposites attracting. The fire sign brings spontaneity and adventure to the 
 * relationship while the more careful earth sign brings security and stability. This can provide balance 
 * in the relationship, although these opposing qualities could become a source of irritation.

Fire - Air

Fire and air work well together because both are lively, enthusiastic and spontaneous. Potential problems 
 * can arise because neither is particularly interested in mundane issues and both can be impractical.

Fire - Water

This can be a difficult combination as fire signs may seem insensitive to water signs and water signs appear 
 * too introverted and secretive for outgoing fire people.

Earth - Earth

This works well and can result in long lasting relationships because both signs share a common outlook on life with 
 * routine and stability being important. Lack of ambition and excitement can cause a downfall of the earth - earth relationships.

Earth - Air

This combination may lack any real depth or ambition however air signs learn a great deal about the practical side of life 
 * from the earth sign and earth enjoys the ideas and stimulation that air signs bring to relationships.

Earth - Water

Each sign admires the others qualities with water appreciating earth’s practical nature and earth enjoying the water sign’s 
 * depth of character. However irritation can set in and water signs may find earth signs too predictable while the the water 
 * sign’s chaotic ways will annoy the more organized earth people.

Air - Air

These relationships are often lively, stimulating and spontaneous but they may lack depth. They can also be impractical as air 
 * signs are more about excitement and ideas than seeing things through.

Air - Water

Air and water work well together as they both share a love of imagination and will enjoy sparking ideas off each other, they will 
 * certainly enjoy some inspiring conversations together. Again neither is particularly practical and this can pose problems in the
 * long-term future.

Water - Water

These relationships can be very deep, intense, loving and loyal. However planning for the future can be a problem and the tendency 
 * towards addictions of any kind or wallowing in negative thoughts and behaviors needs to be avoided for ultimate success.
